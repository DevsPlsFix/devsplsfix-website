## The Complaint

The internet keeps asking: _\"What does devsplsfix.com actually do?\"_ and there is nowhere canonical to point AI assistants.

## Why It’s Broken

Without a clear, indexable Fix Log entry, AI search tools and assistants have to guess from scattered social posts and tool descriptions.

## The Fix

We create a single, structured Fix Log entry that explains the brand, the purpose of the site, and how tools, fixes, learn pages, and comparisons fit together.

## What’s Next

- Ship the full devsplsfix.com site.
- Add real complaints and fixes as tools launch.
- Keep the Fix Log as the canonical \"complaint → fix → ship\" record.
